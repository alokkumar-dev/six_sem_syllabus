  <h2>MAJOR PROJECT WORK </h2>
  <h>RATIONALE</h>
  <p>
  Major Project Work aims at developing innovative skills in the students whereby they apply in totality the knowledge
  and skills gained through the course work in the solution of particular problem or by undertaking a project. The
  individual students have different aptitudes and strengths. Project work, therefore, should match the strengths of
  students. For this purpose, students should be asked to identify the type of project work, they would like to execute. It
  is also essential that the faculty of the respective department may have a brainstorming to identify suitable project
  assignments for their students. The project assignment can be individual assignment or a group assignment. There
  should not be more than 3 students if the project work is given to a group. The students should identify themselves or
  accept the given project assignment at least two to three months in advance. The project work identified in
  collaboration with industry should be preferred. Each teacher is expected to guide the project work of 5â€“6 students.
  The project assignments may consist of:
  Programming customer-based applications
  Web page designing (Only dynamic)
  Database applications
  Software Development
